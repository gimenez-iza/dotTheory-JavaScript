/*For this Code Challenge you need to use JavaScript's Math methods. Declare a new variable named tempRounded. 
Assign it the temperature variable rounded to the nearest integer.
*/

/*Next, declare a new variable named tempRoundDown. 
Assign it the temperature variable rounded downward to the nearest integer. 
Check the Mozilla Developer Network to find the proper Math method (hint: down is toward the "floor".)
